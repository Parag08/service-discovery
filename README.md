# service-discovery

<b>Consul based service discovery for nodejs application</b>

this service discovery can be used by any microservice architecture  
   
<b>bugs and improvements</b>

1. If a service(library) only wants to interact with other service and doesn't want to become a part itself [there should be provision for such services also]
2. wrappers can be created in any language as it's just a Http request [create wrapper for python, go and java]
